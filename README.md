# Fresh Landing page
![](https://cssninja.io/storage/app/media/external/fresh/fresh-hero-ui8.png)

Fresh is a one page landing page starter built by [Css Ninja Studio](https://cssninja.io). Fresh is licensed under the MIT license.

You can access the full demo [here](https://cssninjastudio.github.io/fresh/).

## Details

Fresh is developed with the [Bulma css framework](https://bulma.io)

**Version 3.0.0**

## Usage
Fresh is now a Bulma starter fully bundled with **npm** and **gulp**. Bulma has been upgraded to the latest version **0.8.0**.

* Clone or download the repo
* Run `npm install`
* Run `gulp dev`

Most of the dependencies have been sanitized. However, **Panini** will keep throwing 2 npm warnings (low and moderatem, since Panini is only used during development, that shouldn't be a problem). We already got in touch with Zurb / Foundation to have this problem solved.

## About Us

Css Ninja is a web design studio. We build handcrafted and polished templates that will give some hype to your startup or to your next project.

### Note

Changes should be commited to `src/` files only.

### How to use

The template is built with Sass and Gulp build system with these features:

-	Handlebars HTML templates with Panini– Panini is a super simple flat file generator for use with Gulp. It compiles a series of HTML pages using a common layout. These pages can also include HTML partials, external Handlebars helpers, or external data as JSON.
-	Sass compilation, prefixing with Autoprefixer, and JavaScript concatenation
-	Built-in BrowserSync server - Will automatically reload your page when files are changed. It also live-injects CSS changes when you save a Sass file. This task runs continuously. Defaults to localhost.
-	For production builds - CSS compression, JavaScript compression, Image compression and more..


### Requirements

To use this template, your computer needs:

-	Node.js is used to run the build processes. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
-   Test: run ` node -v ` in the terminal
-	Npm (Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm.) Used to manage development dependencies.
-   Test: run ` npm -v`  in the terminal
-	Gulp – task runner
	`npm install -g gulp`
-	Test: run `gulp -v ` in the terminal
